# Group 4 EEET2574: Big Data for Engineering Assignment 3 Repository
## Problem Statement : 
The objective of this project is to identify regions with similar economic, deforestation, and weather patterns in order to provide tailored policy recommendations.

## Technology/Infrastructure/Models

### Technology Stack

#### Programming Languages
- Python for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
- MongoDB for database operations.

#### Libraries and Frameworks
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- NumPy for numerical computations.
- Flask for building the web application (if applicable).

### Infrastructure

#### Cloud Platform
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud computing and storage.

#### Database
- MongoDB for non-relational database management.

#### Streaming Data Processing
- Apache Kafka for handling real-time streaming data.

### Models

#### Clustering Algorithm
- K-Means clustering for identifying regions with similar economic, deforestation, and weather patterns.

#### Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression or Time Series Analysis for predicting future economic trends.
- Decision Trees or Random Forest for analyzing deforestation patterns.




## Data Sources

### Streaming Data
- Weather data sourced from the OpenWeather API.

### Saved Data and Files

- Vietnam deforestation data from the [Global Forest Watch website](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/?mainMap=eyJoaWRlTGVnZW5kIjp0cnVlLCJzaG93QW5hbHlzaXMiOnRydWV9&map=eyJjZW50ZXIiOnsibGF0IjoxNi4wMjgwMjY3MjEwNjM1NCwibG5nIjoxMDUuODA2OTAwMDAwMDAwOTV9LCJ6b29tIjo0LjYzMTg5MDk3NTA2NDc1OSwiY2FuQm91bmQiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D&mapMenu=eyJzZWFyY2giOiJ2aWV0biJ9)

- Vietnam social-economic data from the [Vietnam General Statistics Office](https://wtocenter.vn/an-pham/22213-socio-economic-data-of-63-provinces-and-centrally-run-cities-2015-2021) (available as a PDF report).




## Data Storage
Our data is organized in the "../clean/data/" directory:

- Raw deforestation dataset: "../clean/data/LoveWaterdata.xlsx"
